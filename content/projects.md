# {{< fa tractor >}} | A tale of two (groups of) bees: why are some midwestern bumble bees struggling while others thrive?
**PhD Dissertation Research | University of Wisconsin-Madison**
Recently, a number of high profile studies on the status of bumble bees have sounded alarms among ecologists, entomologists, and the public writ large.  These familiar, fluffy friends are not only a harbinger of spring and summer, they are important pollinators of a number of important agricultural crops thanks to their ability to buzz pollinate, visit crops on cold/wet days (thanks to a warm coat of "fur" which entomologists call "pile"), and other morphological adaptations.

Despite the importance of bumble bees, a number of species have exhibited marked declines over the last 50 years.  A number of factors have been implicated, including climate change, habitat loss, novel pathogens, and insecticide use.  Surprisingly, the same period of time that saw several species populations plummet has seen others increase dramatically.  This temporal linkage in species status, traceable to a period in the mid 20th century, suggests that the same factors might be responsible for the rise of some bumble bee species while others struggle.

This begs the question: _what has changed over the last century that could have led the observed dichotomy of bumble bee population trends?_  Most studies suggest that as agriculture has taken over as the dominate land-use in the world, bumble bees have lost vital habitat and flowers - the sole source of food for foraging bumble bees.  In the place of flower-rich meadows and wetlands, we have planted vast monocultures that only provide pollen and/or nectar for short periods of time.  Because bumble bee colonies are active throughout the spring and summer, they need consistent supplies of pollen and nectar to successfully grow and reproduce.  The thought is that some species are far better able to adapt to these changes than others, accounting for the differential response of bumble bee species.

The above question was the driving force behind my PhD research.  To begin to address it, I examined a common, increasing species in the eastern US, the common eastern bumble bee (_Bombus impatiens_), to evaluate its response to modern agricultural landscapes.  Additionally, I linked museum and citizen science observations of bumble bees to agricultural practices to determine whether an increase in the intensity of agricultural practices could explain both the rise of species like _B. impatiens_ and the decline of others such as _B. terricola_.
