# Hello!
Welcome to my newly deployed website.  It's long been a project on my to-do list to migrate from Wordpress to something a bit less clunky, more simple, and that would help me learn more about coding for the web.  I finally gathered (read: made) the time to sit down and write some code and deploy this new site via Hugo.  In fact, I think I'll make this endeavor the topic of a soon-to-be-written blog post.

This site will have a few different purposes:
1. To serve as a digital CV for myself
2. To write R/analysis-centric blog posts to help folks with ecological/landscape analyses and other R trickery that I've found helpful over the years.  So many other blogs posts/personal websites of fellow ecologists have helped me along the way, and I'm eager to give back to the communities and hopefully help budding researchers in their own work.
3. To help further develop science communication skills - especially distilling the work that I do into easily digestible tidbits that are accessible to a diversity of readers.
4. To serve as a small portfolio of my photography and bumble bee-centric graphic design work.
