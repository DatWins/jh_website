Designing captivating, informative, and beautiful scientific presentations became a passion of mine during graduate school.  When attending professional meetings, I quickly noticed the presentation styles that captured my attention and those that fell short.  For me, how the information is conveyed **_visually_** is just as important the verbal or written delivery.  I started re-thinking my presentations entirely - most of which, at the time, fell into the "standard" format most scientists are taught as part of their training.  The dreaded IMRaD.  The new style I adopted was image and graphics-heavy, but I had a hard time locating existing, open-source graphics in a style that suited me and were the organisms that I studied.  So, I set out to make my own.

After many long nights of futzing around in Illustrator, I slowly cobbled together the skills necessary to make the content that I wanted.  As it turns out, a few other folks in the bumble bee world felt the same way and reached out to use some of the content that I created.  As such, I'm posting things here so that folks can use them in their presentations and manuscripts as needed.  _**I do ask, however, that you provide attribution as these took some time to make!**_

Do you have an idea for a graphic that you want to talk about? Please reach out! I'd love to do some "commission" work with folks across taxa and scientific areas.
