# A tale of two (groups of) bees: why are some midwestern bumble bees struggling while others thrive?
**PhD Dissertation Research | University of Wisconsin-Madison**

Recently, a number of high profile studies on the status of bumble bees have sounded alarms among ecologists, entomologists, and the public writ large.  These familiar, fluffy friends are not only a harbinger of spring and summer, they are important pollinators of a number of important agricultural crops thanks to their ability to buzz pollinate, visit crops on cold/wet days (thanks to a warm coat of "fur" which entomologists call "pile"), and other morphological adaptations.

Despite the importance of bumble bees, a number of species have exhibited marked declines over the last 50 years.  A number of factors have been implicated, including climate change, habitat loss, novel pathogens, and insecticide use.  Surprisingly, the same period of time that saw several species populations plummet has seen others increase dramatically.  This temporal linkage in species status, traceable to a period in the mid 20th century, suggests that the same factors might be responsible for the rise of some bumble bee species while others struggle.

This begs the question: _**what has changed over the last century that could have led the observed dichotomy of bumble bee population trends?**_  Most studies suggest that as agriculture has taken over as the dominate land-use in the world, bumble bees have lost vital habitat and flowers - the sole source of food for foraging bumble bees.  In the place of flower-rich meadows and wetlands, we have planted vast monocultures that only provide pollen and/or nectar for short periods of time.  Because bumble bee colonies are active throughout the spring and summer, they need consistent supplies of pollen and nectar to successfully grow and reproduce.  The thought is that some species are far better able to adapt to these changes than others, accounting for the differential response of bumble bee species.

The above question was the driving force behind my PhD research.  To begin to address it, I examined a common, increasing species in the eastern US, the common eastern bumble bee (_Bombus impatiens_), to evaluate its response to modern agricultural landscapes.  Additionally, I linked museum and citizen science observations of bumble bees to agricultural practices to determine whether an increase in the intensity of agricultural practices could explain both the rise of species like _B. impatiens_ and the decline of others such as _B. terricola_.

Each of my PhD chapters is listed below, and a brief summary of the results of each follows:

#### {{< fa stopwatch >}} Floral resource pulse decreases bumble bee foraging trip duration in central Wisconsin agroecosystem
Resource pulses, narrow periods of high resource availability, can elicit strong behavioral responses across diverse taxa. Mass-flowering agricultural crops are an example of a resource pulse that insect pollinators exploit. However, the underlying mechanism behind changes in pollinator behavior associated with mass-flowering crops is still relatively unexplored. The present study quantified the behavioral response of bumble bees, an important wild pollinator, to commercial cranberry bloom, an important mass-flowering crop in Wisconsin, U.S.A. Over a 2-year period, foraging trip duration was measured using radio frequency identification at 14 farms situated across landscape contexts, ranging from high to low natural area (woodland amount). Using transect surveys, floral resource abundance at a landscape scale was estimated. It was found that bumble bees were highly sensitive to temporal changes in landscape-level resource abundance associated with the onset of cranberry bloom, during which they decreased foraging trip duration by 22% and increased the number of foraging trips during bloom by 24% on average relative to the period before and after bloom. This phenomenon was consistent across colonies, individual bees, and landscape contexts, despite a higher abundance of flowers in low woodland landscapes. Bumble bee colonies growing in low- and high-woodland landscapes exhibited a similar performance. As mass-flowering crops are probably a factor influencing bumble bee foraging behavior in agricultural regions, investigations should continue into how variable resource landscapes, particularly those offering resource pulses, affect wild pollinators and the pollination services they provide. _Ecological Entomology_ 2018.

#### {{< fa wave-square >}} Saved by the pulse? Separating the effects of total and temporal food abundance on the growth and reproduction of bumble bee microcolonies
The loss of flower-rich habitat in agricultural landscapes is a key factor contributing to bumble bee declines across Europe and North America. Yet, agricultural intensification has not only altered flower abundance in the landscape, but also affected when flowers are available during the season (e.g., mass-flowering crops). While we know that both total pollen and nectar as well as temporal availability can impact bumble bee colony success (growth and reproductive output), we have yet to understand how these two factors combined might manifest. We designed an experiment to decouple the effects of total food abundance and its temporal availability on bumble bee microcolony development by exposing them to either constant or pulsed food availability at a high and low ration level. Microcolonies provided constant, high-rations of food grew the most, while those fed variable, but high rations gained less mass over the course of the experiment. Regardless of the temporal presentation of food, microcolonies fed low rations gained little mass over the experiment. Reproductive output was greatest in microcolonies fed high rations, regardless of the temporal availability of food, while those given low rations produced on average 27\% fewer drones. This study highlights the importance of flower abundance for both colony growth and reproduction, regardless of how food is presented (e.g., constantly or in a pulse). Together, these results indicate that increasing total food abundance will have the greatest, positive impact on colony fitness. _In revision_

#### {{< fa wave-square >}} Equivalent growth and reproduction of field colonies of common eastern bumble bees (_Bombus impatiens_ Cresson) despite differential temporal resource availability
Centuries of anthropogenic landscape alterations, primarily for agricultural purposes, have dramatically changed the temporal availability of wildflowers that support key pollinating insects such as bumble bees. The ability of bumble bees to adapt to these changes is paramount to ensure species persistence, and while several species appear to be unable to withstand more variable floral resource abundance, several others may be suited to exploit these conditions. We tested whether free-foraging colonies of an increasingly common species, _Bombus impatiens_, performed equally well given access to either temporally continuous, or temporally variable purple tansy (_Phacelia tanacetifolia_) plantings, and also compared these to a control landscape lacking phacelia plantings. We found that colonies given access to phacelia grew at slightly elevated rates relative to control colonies, however total mass gain was consistent regardless of the treatment. Colonies with access to phacleia produced similar numbers of gynes, however that number was 125% greater landscape control colonies. Together, these results suggest that, despite differential temporal availability of phacelia (continuous planting versus a single, large pulse), colonies of _B. impatiens_ were able to exploit those resources equally, resulting in elevated production of gynes relative to control landscapes with no phacelia. Our results support the adaptive capacity of _B. impatiens_ in dealing with highly disturbed landscapes, and suggest that studies comparing common species responses to those of rarer species are needed. _In prep_

#### {{< fa chart-line >}} Modeling bumble bee abundance using land cover, expert opinion, and empirical approaches to estimating spatiotemporal floral resource abundance
The quantification of floral resources is essential to understand patterns of bee diversity and abundance, particularly in the context of stemming ongoing bee declines through flower-planting based conservation initiatives. A variety of methodological approaches are used to quantify floral landscapes, including land cover based proxies, expert opinion, and empirical estimates. Each approach offers unique challenges, and as of yet no studies have directly compared these three methods in any context. We quantified flower abundance of a diverse agricultural landscape in central Wisconsin using all three methods, and then compared estimated flower abundance, as well as the predictive power of each approach in estimating bumble bee abundance. We found that, despite dramatic differences in floral resource estimates (particularly among expert and empirical approaches), each approach performed similarly in predicting bumble bee abundance. The comparisons presented here offer a decision framework to those pursuing questions in need of floral resource quantification, as well as provide a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. _In prep_

#### {{< fa tractor >}} The fate of bumble bees in the north-central United States parallels historical patterns of agricultural intensification
The decline of North American bumble bees has been tentatively linked to changes in agricultural practices over the last century.  Researchers posit that a switch from the diverse and less intensive agricultural systems of the early 1900's to the largely monocultural, heavy-input systems of today has likely impacted both nesting habitat and floral resource availability with negative consequences for bumble bee populations and communities.  Despite several long-term analyses highlighting concerning population trends, no studies have yet explicitly linked metrics of agricultural intensification to bumble bee declines.  Using an extensive long term set of both bumble bee records and US agricultural census records, we show that metrics of increasing agricultural intensity are clearly associated with the decline of a 40% of bumble bee species in the US Midwest.  Additionally, we document several species increasing in relative abundance that positively associate with agricultural intensity, suggesting our agricultural practices have inadvertently selected winners and losers in the bumble bee community over the last century.  In addition to suggesting future avenues for controlled, manipulative experiments, our results suggest that changes to our agricultural practice and policies are required in order to limit additional declines of Midwestern bumble bees. _In prep_
