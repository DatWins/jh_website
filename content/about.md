I am a bumble bee ecologist interested in how anthropogenic changes to the landscape and environment (e.g., agriculture and climate change) impact bumble bee behavior, colony growth and reproduction, and populations and communities.  Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher stationed at UC-Davis where I work with [Neal Williams](https://williamslab.ucdavis.edu/ "Williams Lab Website") on bumble bee responses to heatwaves.

I recently completed my PhD with [Claudio Gratton](https://gratton.entomology.wisc.edu "Gratton Lab Website") at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I sought to develop an understanding of how common species such as the common eastern bumble bee (_Bombus impatiens_) cope with variable floral abundance brought about by agroecosystem management (e.g., mass-flowering crops).  My work also explored the diverging population patterns of [Midwestern bumble bee species](https://www.wisconsinbumblebees.com "Wisconsin Bumble Bee Guide") in response to agricultural intensification using historic agricultural census data and bumble bee records.

Overall, I aim to improve our understanding of the factors that allow some bumble bee species to succeed while others struggle and, in doing so, help to develop more robust conservation strategies for bumble bees.

When I'm not in the field/lab or writing code, I can be found photographing all manners of things, climbing rocks, on my bike, on a hockey rink, or nerding out about Italian wine.
